# music-event-finder

This is a small passion project of mine built during a summer time back in college. As a frequent concert and music festival go-er,
I was finding it difficult and exhausting to constantly having to access multiple websites to gauge the price of an event, figuring out what artist is
performing, how the price compares to the other similar events, and listening to pieces from unfamiliar events that I will be attending,
hence, I have decided to build a web application that solves all of these issues in a centralized environment through a single artist name search.
