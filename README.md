# music-event-finder

This is a small passion project of mine built during a summer time back in college. As a frequent concert and music festival go-er,
I was finding it difficult and exhausting to constantly having to access multiple websites to gauge the price of an event, figuring out what artist is
performing, how the price compares to the other similar events, and listening to pieces from unfamiliar events that I will be attending,
hence, I have decided to build a web application that solves all of these issues in a centralized environment through a single artist name search.

### How I would build it again
As I have gone back and look at the project, I've noticed there were redundant styling choices and component designs to be improved on. For simplicity, better visualization for delivering greater user experience, and streamlining the development process, I would leverage popular and widely used third-party packages, such as `styled components` for creating a more efficient and cleaner code structure in applying styles to components, and `redux` for managing a centralized state while also enforcing a structured way to mutate state properties and dispatching various services like making API calls.
